# React Notepad
This is a sample React app that I experiment mostly React Hooks and try to
find out the best practices for certain cases of React App Development.

The purpose of the project is not to have a complete Notepad app but rather to have
a sandbox repository that I can learn and experiment core and advanced concepts of
React App Development and try to implement them following well-known best-practices or
my-own-best-practices. With that, this project will never be completed or be working
properly all the time either.
